#### Recent works:

- [x] [InternImage [CVPR2023 Highlight]](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternImage) - Best performing image-based universal backbone model with up to 3 billion parameters. 90.1% Top1 accuracy in ImageNet, 65.5 mAP on COCO object detection, 62.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.
- [x] [ViT-Adapter [ICLR2023 Spotlight]](https://github.com/czczup/ViT-Adapter/) - A simple yet powerful adapter for pure ViT, which can remedy the defects of ViT and achieve comparable performance to vision-specific models in dense prediction tasks.
- [x] [GPTrans [IJCAI2023]](https://github.com/czczup/GPTrans) - This work presents a novel transformer architecture for graph representation learning.
- [x] [URST [AAAI2022]](https://github.com/czczup/URST) - URST is a versatile framework for ultra-high resolution style transfer under limited GPU memory resources.
- [x] [InternGPT](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternGPT) - An open-source demo platform where you can easily showcase your AI models. Now it supports DragGAN, ChatGPT, ImageBind, multimodal chat like GPT-4, SAM, interactive image editing, etc.
- [x] [VisionLLM](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/VisionLLM) - A unified perspective for vision and language tasks by treating images as a foreign language and aligning vision-centric tasks with language tasks that can be flexibly defined and managed using language instructions.
- [x] [DDP](https://github.com/JiYuanFeng/DDP) - DDP extends the denoising diffusion process into the modern perception pipeline and shows attractive properties such as dynamic inference and uncertainty awareness.

#### Competitions:
- [x] [WSDM Cup 2023](https://github.com/czczup/ViT-Adapter/tree/main/wsdm2023) - 1st place in the Toloka VQA Challenge.
- [x] [Ego4D 2022](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ego4d-eccv2022-solutions) - 1st place in 5 Ego4D challenges.
- [x] [NAIC 2020](https://github.com/czczup/NAIC_RS_NJU_FINAL) - 1st place in the remote sensing semantic segmentation track.
